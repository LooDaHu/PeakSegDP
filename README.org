PeakSegDP

This code was used to compute the state-of-the-art peak detection
results described in the "[[https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegDP-NIPS][PeakSeg: Peak detection via constrained optimal segmentation]]," 
(4-page paper for NIPS 2014 workshop on machine learning in
computational biology) and "[[https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSeg-paper][PeakSeg: constrained optimal segmentation and supervised penalty learning for peak detection in count data]]" (8-page paper)
by Hocking TD, Rigaill G, and Bourque G.
