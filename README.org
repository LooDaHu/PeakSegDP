PeakSeg is a constrained maximum Poisson likelihood segmentation model
described in "[[http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/hocking15.html][PeakSeg: constrained optimal segmentation and supervised
penalty learning for peak detection in count data]]" ([[https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSeg-paper][source]]). We
proposed a [[file:src/cDPA.c][constrained Dynamic Programming Algorithm]] (cDPA) for
computing a model that satisfies the PeakSeg constraints, available in
this R package as the =PeakSegDP= function.

Notes: 
- As explained in Section 4.3 of the paper, the cDPA is a heuristic
  that is not guaranteed to find the global optimum (an algorithm that
  provably recovers the PeakSeg model would make for an interesting
  future research paper).
- For supervised peak detection in ChIP-seq data sets with several
  samples, see our newer method, [[https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegJoint][PeakSegJoint]].
